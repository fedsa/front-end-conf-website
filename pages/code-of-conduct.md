FEDSA meetups and conferences are community events for networking in the Front End Developer South Africa community. We value the participation of each member of the community and want all attendees and sponsors to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. 

All attendees and sponsors are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees. To make clear what is expected, all attendees and sponsors are required to conform to this Code of Conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout events.

## TL;DR

- Be respectful of others, including non-members
- Do not harass others
- Do not share anyone’s personal information without their permission
- All content must be "safe for work"

This is a safe space, let's keep it that way

## Code of Conduct

"FEDSA" in this document refers to the the Front End Developer South Africa organisation at https://fedsa.org/. "The organisers" refers to the administrators on this organisation, which can be accessed [here](https://www.meetup.com/fedsa-community/members/?op=leaders).

FEDSA is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all FEDSA spaces, including all events (online and in-person), direct messages, and any communication between members. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the organisers.

Harassment includes:

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
- Deliberate misgendering or use of "dead" or rejected names
- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images
- Inappropriate sexual behaviour
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Physical contact and simulated physical contact (e.g., textual descriptions like "hug" or "backrub") without consent or after a request to stop
- Threats of violence
- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
- Deliberate intimidation
- Stalking or following
- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
- Sustained disruption of discussion
- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
- Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse
- Publication of non-harassing private communication

## Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member of FEDSA, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns there are a few methods for reporting. Organisers will respond as soon as they are able. If the person who is harassing you is on the organising team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident.

- DM an [organiser](https://www.meetup.com/fedsa-community/members/?op=leaders)
- During an online event send a private message to an organiser
- During an in-person event approach one of the organisers

This code of conduct applies to FEDSA spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of FEDSA outside of our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by FEDSA members, especially the administrators, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from FEDSA based on their past behavior, including behavior outside FEDSA spaces and behavior towards people who are not members of the FEDSA community.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of FEDSA members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.
Acceptable Content

It is expected that the content made available by members of the community should at all times adhere to the acceptable content policy. This policy is intended to protect the community's image, as well as the image of its members, through restrictions on certain classes of content which may be deemed to be unsuitable in a work or social context.

Links to content are deemed as acceptable as the content within.

Classes of content which we deem to be unsuitable include:

- Pornographic or sexually suggestive material, either in graphic or text form.
- Depictions of physical or emotional abuse, either in graphic or text form.
- Persecution of any individual as a result of their race, gender, religion or other physical traits.
- Material intended to, without basis, harm the reputation of any individual whether a member or not.
- Unsolicited advertising.
- Links, or links to pages, for the purpose of monetization of user views and which provide no value to the FEDSA community.
- Content infringing on copyright laws.

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all FEDSA spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other FEDSA members and/or the general public.

Intentionally evading exclusions, bans, suspensions, restrictions, or otherwise interfering with the admin team's decisions and actions are not permitted.
